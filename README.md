# Linked Movie App

This is a university project for the lecture *Semantic Web & Linked Data*.

The goal was to utilize Semantic Web technologies. We decided to built an app that allows you to create a tree similar to the [Google Knowledge Graph](https://www.google.com/intl/bn/insidesearch/features/search/knowledge.html) based on the movie data on [LinkedMDB](http://www.linkedmdb.org/).

### Technologies
- [vue.js](http://visjs.org/)
- [Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io/)
